      I graduated from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in December 2021 with a degree in Nutrition, concentration
      in Applied Nutrition, and a minor in Fruit Science. After taking some time to travel and gain more
      expereince working at a winery, I decided that I not longer wished to pursue the field of nutrition. 
      As a result of talking to friends, industry professionals, and doing a lot of research, I realized that
      software development both interested and challenged me, so I wished to pursue this field.

        Outside of coding I enjoy baking for my friends and family, reading Hercule Poroit mystery books, 
        biking, and surfing on one of the two surfboards I shaped myself in college. Having been on the Cal 
        Poly sailing team sailing small two person sail boats, I am currently learning how to sail larger sail boats.
